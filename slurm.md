# SLURM Configuration of Virtual box cluster

## Setup
Install munge that is used by slurm as authentication service, on all nodes. If you are using a Virtual box cluster, install it on one virtual machine and then clone it.
```bash
sudo apt-get install munge slurm-wlm
```

Remember to copy file ```/etc/munge/munge.key``` from master to all other nodes, in order to share it across all nodes.

## Configuration file

This is a little bit akward, it is the main source of errors if it is not well formed.

I used this one for my cluster of master+node01, file should be created in ```/etc/slurm-llnl/slurm.conf```.
In the slurm installation dir, an automatic configurator html page is created but I suggest to use a custom file since I had difficulties to install the scheduler with the automatic version.

```conf

# Put this file on all nodes of your cluster.

This is a stable version of my slurm.conf file.

On the master you must do these lines to enable slurm controller service.
```bash
sudo systemctl enable slurmctld
sudo systemctl start slurmctld
```
The slurm daemons must be started in all nodes.
```bash
sudo systemctl enable slurmd
sudo systemctl start slurmd
```
